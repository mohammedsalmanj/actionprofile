Run vProfile App Locally (Docker)

Follow these steps to build and launch the vProfile application locally using Docker.

🧩 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

🐳 Docker Desktop installed and running

✅ Verified by running:

docker --version
docker info


(If you get an error, start Docker Desktop first.)

⚙️ 2️⃣ Build the Docker Image

From the root directory of the project, run:

docker build -t vprofile:test .


This command:

Uses the Dockerfile to build a Tomcat image containing your compiled WAR file

Tags the image as vprofile:test

✅ To confirm the image built successfully:

docker images


You should see something like:

REPOSITORY     TAG     IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
vprofile       test    a1b2c3d4e5f6   2 minutes ago    590MB

🧱 3️⃣ Run the Container

Start the app container:

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name vprofile-container vprofile:test


This command:

Runs the container in the background (-d)

Maps your system’s port 8080 to the container’s 8080

Names the container vprofile-container

✅ Verify it’s running:

docker ps


Expected output:

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
c0ffee123abc   vprofile:test   Up 10 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   vprofile-container

🌐 4️⃣ Access the Application

Once running, open your browser and go to:

👉 http://localhost:8080

If everything worked, you should see your vProfile web application loaded on Tomcat.

🧾 5️⃣ View Logs (Optional)

To monitor Tomcat logs:

docker logs -f vprofile-container


You should see:

INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in XXXX ms


Once you see “Server startup”, your app is ready 🎯

🧹 6️⃣ Stop & Clean Up

When done, stop and remove the container:

docker stop vprofile-container
docker rm vprofile-container


If you want to remove the image as well:

docker rmi vprofile:test
